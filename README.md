Water management system using IOT

Summary:-
This project is about motor automation which is very useful in the daily life, it has feature like automatic turning off the motor with the help water level sensor after the tank is been filled and  automatic turns on the motor  when the tank is empty ,here the  Arduino Nano is been used as the brain of this project as it control the entire work like checking water level, For water level  ULTRA-SONIC SENSOR is used to check the level of the water in the tank .
			
This Project Is Useful for Daily Life Because We Know Many Times we Forget to Turn Off the Water Motor and Very Large Amount of Water Is Wasted Annually, After Using This Project We Can Turn of Motor Automatic According to Our Need.
